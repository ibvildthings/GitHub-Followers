# GitHub-Followers

This app lets you search for any Github user, to see who follows them.

I have implemented a simple UI that displays the followers of a given GitHub user in a grid. 
1. You can search for any github username. I've used GitHubâ€™s API to fetch all the data.
2. Each row in the grid has three cells and each cell displays the avatar and username of that follower. 
3. Tapping on a cell should take you to a separate screen where you can see the details of the follower: name, email, location, repo count, following count, and follower count.


While building this app I initially, mistakely tried to fetch data for all the followers. This resulted in me hitting the rate-limits for Guthub API. But then I changed it so that details for a follower is requested only when you tap on the user picture.
